Glenn Fogel:
Hi everyone. I have another great Glenn & Guests, and I have a guest who I've just been waiting to get this for some time. I'm just anxious awaiting this because the man is Frank Slootman. Frank is a legend, a legend in the software industry. It's the enterprise software industry. So he is currently the Chairman and CEO of Snowflake. I think many of you know this is a data cloud company. And before that, he was President and CEO of a company called ServiceNow, which we do a lot of business with. He grew that company from a hundred million revenue all the way up to 1.4 billion, and took it public. Great thing. He's written a book about what he's accomplished and helps other people like us do better too. It's called Amp It Up: Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency, and Elevating Intensity. And we're going to talk about that today.
First question, Frank, is what would you say are some of the key things in the book for people who haven't read it yet and that we may want to look very closely at to help us do better?
Frank Slootman:
Good to be with you, Glenn, this morning. First off, I didn't write this book to be a philosophy of sorts. I am not presumptuous in that way at all. We got a lot of questions over the years, literally over the last 20 years like, "Hey, there must be a secret source." It's a typical American thing, by the way. Can I just extract a formula here and apply it? A playbook, you know all the terms that we use in the U.S. And I said, "Look, it is that simple, but it also isn't." Right? So I'm going to give you the best explanation I can, one person's account, of why these companies were successful and they're in different industries and different eras and different competitors and different technologies, all this kind of stuff.
What is it that's sort of common among all these experiences? What Amp It Up, people sometimes ask me, "What's the message of the book?" And I go, "Read the title, okay?". The point is there is a lot of room up in an organization in terms of energy and focus and drive, all these things that make up what I believe is the X factor in organizations. It's the difference between winning and losing is sitting right in that margin. People are not very aware of it because they kind of float through the day and they have many things on their mind, but they don't show up with their A ++ game in every single encounter, every single meeting, every single message. There's this room up that is now taken consistently by people.
That's really the point here. I always say, "We aim too low and we move too slow." And you need to remember that every time you're in a situation, whatever the situation is. If you're writing an email, you're doing a podcast, you are addressing a group of people, you're meeting with a customer, every time you have room up. I'm telling you, you have room up. You can learn this from people like the late Steve Jobs. I mean he aimed ins– he literally used the word "insanely great". He aimed insanely high because he wasn't interested in anything other than insanely great, right? By the way, that's a tough standard to live up to, but it starts in the culture and the attitude and the posture that you bring to your workday minute in, minute out. So the concept is simple. Doing it nonstop is very, very hard.
Glenn Fogel:
One of the things really important in organizations is making sure you're spending your time on the things that are most important for that organization, really focusing. How do you do that? How do you maintain focus? How do you decide what the priorities are?
Frank Slootman:
Well, it's constant effort, right? Here's the issue, right? As humans, we add more and more stuff. Over time, you're a mile wide and an inch deep and you're swimming in molasses. That's the feeling. And nothing is getting done. Nothing is getting done very quickly. Nothing is getting done very well. So the whole dynamic is just horrible, right? So if you want to change that, you want to just sort of unpack that hairball of all this stuff, right? And you do that by looking at stuff and going like, "Okay, if I do nothing else this year, what absolutely must, must, must happen and why? What are the reasons?" Let's just have that conversation. Let's just try that on for size. Let's see what happens when we sort of confront our demons and say, "Look, what is the one thing that must, must, must happen?"
And maybe it's not one thing, right? I don't want to be so verbatim about it. Maybe it's two things or three things, but at least you're starting to unpack this thing because we got to go more sequential instead of parallel. Parallelism just grinds us down into dust and we're moving slow, we're getting nothing done, we're lowering our standards, all these kinds of things. So I really want to unpack things, have really high clarity, lighten the load, and create speed and momentum in terms of moving through issues and topics.
Glenn Fogel:
Yeah. One of the things we had to prioritize on, and I imagine many companies in our industry and others like ours, is the regulatory landscape has changed so much over the last few years. It's just become so complex and trying to keep up with it all and changes that one has to make in one's business to meet it. Well just your perspective on all of the increased regulations in basically the e-commerce area.
Frank Slootman:
Yeah. Well, look, increased regulations are not fun. There are additional constraints. They are going to consume resources. We got to figure out how to do it right. There's a whole industry, you know, is standing up to basically consult with you or provide services for you. I get it, right? But at the same time, let me take the other side of the argument, it sort of becomes a moat around the business. It becomes incredibly difficult for other people to enter the business because of a high bar there is for even being in the business, let alone being great at it. In other words, yeah, it is a hassle. Well, it's a hassle for everybody else too, so let's do this efficiently and effectively and we're going to own a big part of the place here because, in other words, the barriers to entry are so high. I think one of the famous Dutch soccer players always said, "Every disadvantage has its advantage." And we said that.
Glenn Fogel:
Another thing where there's going to be a lot of regulatory framework down the road is AI, and I'm sure you have some opinions about that. First, what do you think in terms of all the new gen AI, is this going to be the greatest thing since the invention of taking control of fire and the wheel? Or is this like a lot of hype and it's not going to make that big a difference for a long time? What do you think?
Frank Slootman:
Well, I mean there's no doubt that we're at the top of the hype cycle, and the hype cycle is one of these concepts where you go through this euphoric phase where things are just amazing and then the reality slowly sets in and we go through what they call the trough of disillusionment. From there, you start to gradually, you know, basically it's sort of an asymptotic function that sort of starts to approach a reality. That always happens in tech, and that's okay. I do believe that AI is going to have incredible long-lasting impacts. I certainly remember the world before we had internet search, and I wished to hell we had had internet search when I was a much younger man, but we didn't. We had to go to a library, which is painful as hell. I've been a search junkie ever since because I find it the most addictive thing because I can't help myself. I constantly got to look things up and research things. I have to know.
I think that AI will be orders of magnitude greater impact than even internet search. And search has become quite good in terms of working on bias and hallucination, all these terms where AI is not very good. I mean it's just glaringly wrong all the time. It's very, very crude still. What it has the potential to do is to bridge the gap that has existed between man and machine. Since the dawn of computing, we've had a huge divide between people and machines and we had these incredible arcane languages that we had to learn, programming languages to be able to interact with machines. Now is that going to be there? I just have to turn it on and then, poof, it's all there? No, it's going to take time. It's going to take time.
The large language models, obviously they work really well with language, hence the name, which means unstructured data, especially text, it will work on other modalities meaning audio, video and so on. But so far we only know it an environment of unstructured text. By the way, so much of the world's data is unstructured tests and the vast majority of it really is.
Glenn Fogel:
Do you think there's any significant risks that you occasionally think, gee, I'm a little concerned about the future with some of the new AI that's coming out that you're concerned that may go make significant problems for society in general or any particular areas?
Frank Slootman:
Every technology has its downsides and its risks. That's always been that way. So I don't think this is any different. Do I think this is The Matrix or Terminator 10 or whatever? No, absolutely not. I mean, software is just executing instruction. It has no agency. So we should not get so - I mean if you're naive, yeah, I think it's more dangerous. I mean when I first queried myself on ChatGPT, it said I was the CEO of VMware with great conviction. The thing is absolutely stupid. And by the way, this happens all the time. And by the way, it's only trained up to 2021, so the data is old. There's just tons and tons of stuff. So I mean, who the hell is going to take things verbatim? Nobody does these days. You're going to check many different sources.
And by the way, this is a very important point, right? When it comes to data, being trusted and sanctioned is incredibly important. And this is where most organizations struggle with data, is to create a data universe that is trusted and sanctioned. I see people really struggling with where the data gets to the point where it's authoritative. People say like, "Yeah, this is a single source of truth. We used this for–"
Glenn Fogel:
It's so important, so important that trust is the big thing. I'd like to note that I've had the same issue where I've looked into my biography, ChatGPT, and it did say I was over six feet tall or over two meters, and actually, I'm hoping it will stay for a very, very long time. That hallucination is one that actually gives me great pleasure. We'll see how long until they correct it and we'll see what happens there.
Frank Slootman:
I'm pretty sure you're much better looking as well than you were before, so that would be good.
Glenn Fogel:
Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. So one of the things we always like to end up with is asking guests to recommend a book for everyone. Obviously we have a huge number of people and we always want to make sure they get what is going to improve their knowledge, understanding new things or what may be just enjoyable. I was wondering, do you have a book suggestion for us?
Frank Slootman:
Sure. Two books that I'll highlight and you may be familiar with them, but the first one is a book that is called The Speed of Trust, and it was written by Stephen Covey Jr. Think like 2 million copies sold. It really tries to establish trust as a currency and how you get and lose trust and what it really means as a currency. I call it a currency and it's probably not a good word, but I don't know any other.
The second one, and I'm a big fan of Pat Lencioni, The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, and I've had Pat speak at our company events because he has this whole five-level model and in the top of the pyramid is trust. He says the thing that makes teams dysfunctional is a lack of trust. In other words, he puts his finger right on it. I mean, you can work on anything, but if trust is lacking, nothing will work. So zeroing in on the notion of trust or the currency of trust in organizations and in relationships is incredibly important. By the way, it doesn't matter whether you're just trying to be friends with somebody, whether you're trying to sell something. Whatever it is, if you can bring higher levels of trust to and interaction in a relationship, good things are going to happen. So being aware of it and really leaning into that and understanding it and learning it, I think, is a huge deal. And I think it's underemphasized, generally speaking, in society.
Glenn Fogel:
No, I totally agree with that. Trust is so critical and certainly within the company, trust within it, but also obviously with our customers to trust that we're going to actually provide them with the service that we are saying we're going to provide. That is so critical, especially in a competitive environment like ours.
Frank, I can't thank you enough for spending time with us. Obviously, we're also going to recommend your book Amp It Up, believe me, because I think that's a really important book too. So we have three books actually, not just two. And I just have to thank you again. Obviously we hope to have another opportunity to speak with you again. I look forward to seeing you again personally. Thank you so much, Frank.
Frank Slootman:
You bet, my pleasure.
