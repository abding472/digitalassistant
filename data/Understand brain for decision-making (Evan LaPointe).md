### What are the three layers of brain for decision-making
Foundation Layer: 3 Systems (Safety, Reward, Purpose)
Middle Layer: Focus
Upper Layer: Ability

Brain has different systems that focus on research, creativity, search, collaboration. Leveraging different departments create different answers. Brain has pathways > likely a thought goes down certain thoughts. These pathways can be shaped by personalities. Can also be more intentional (self-awareness of preferences & am I letting preferences shape me?). Simple way to keep track: 
1. Safety- flight/flight (restore our standing, avoid stress)
2. Reward/Desire- Can be narrow where focus just on incentives (‘not my job’)
3. Purpose-Understand Why & Impacted Ppl
Level focus is open mindedness vs. narrow mindedness / deep focus. Ability is shaped by context & reality absorption. Ability also grows by imagination and logic bounds. 

### Collaborating well
We have the capacity to work well with different people with deliberate training. Our brain has traffic cops that regulate based on our personalities. What am I prone to do that doesn’t work for all situations. Need to know my own basis 

Product work - think of your team and pushing your minds to get it right. 
We struggle because everyone has different operating brains and react differently. Our unhappiness emerges bc we expect people to be LIKE us, but are NOT. 

Biz world isn’t hand combat. We are in a habitat and the team is the habitat. Think of companies and teams as little habitats. Create a habitat for high functioning interaction. Hand combat can very often be a function of the habitat design. 

Prime example is coaching vs. managing. Intuitively, great founders understand that people don’t all work certain way. Imagination = hypothesis engine

Treat the meetings more intentionally. 
- Priming - Getting on the same page & converging on same outcomes. 
	- What is great priming?
- Decision-making

Better to debate principles than tactics. Are we prioritizing speed or accuracy. 

Influence is a function of strategy & vision. Your brain will sort ideas by believed, believable, conceivable, not believable. If you have experienced it, you will have it as believed. Every mind based on personalities, the line of demarcation of believed vs. believable, unbelievable, not believed. 

Big parts of ourselves is where our believable threshold ends. Where does our unbelievable starts is where we need to monitor. Do I have the capacity of recognizing what I hold inconceivable can be wrong and willing to hold constructively. 

Know your personality, where is my big 5 model - what is my wiring
Every hire = incremental increase to brain diversity

Be vulnerable, hide it, be unapologetic

The test is core identity test based on big 5 model
If the team needs to be innovative, it will be huge cost if many feel inconceivable and want to feel more grounded. 

The issue with ROI is when the impact is Nth order effect vs. 1st order effect. What is the value of fresh flowers in the four seasons lobby. Either we arduously debate the merits or we say that is a waste of time to debate the merits. That is the culture. The team that spends less time translating satisfactory lang before they move, is the team that moves the fast. 

Translation cost = what is our habitat for believed, believable, conceivable, not believable 

watch for when brain breaks. Strong teams understand their spectrum of personalities and what weaknesses are best patched with strengths 

It requires 
Reverse engineering outcomes to understand what is the focus, what is the speech delivery, what is the config 

Reverse engineering the mindset needed to soil the habitat required for task fit delivery
