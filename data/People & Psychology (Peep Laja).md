### Sales Psychology with Cialdini
==Reciprocity==- Ppl pay back what they receive from others. Ex. give away free then ask later for CTA
==Commitment==- Ppl tend to stick to what they already support. Ex. more commitments over time lead to stronger commitment. 
==Social Proof==-We trust things that are popular or endorsed by those like us. Ex. herd mentality when actions are supportive based on someone else we consciously or subconsiously find similarity with
==Authority==-more likely to take action if told so by a trusted authority
==Liking==-We are more likely to believe, trust, or buy from those we like 
==Scarcity==-We are more drawn to things which are rare

### Behaviorism with BJ Fogg

Desired behavior is a function of ==high motivation==, ==ability==, and ==trigger==
#### üí° key insight
Don't ask ppl to take action unless you have increased their motivation
Reducing friction is important but MORE important to increase motivation

### Neuromarketing basics

[[Is There a Buy Button Inside the Brain (Patrick Renvoise at TEDxBend)]] - for more background

What it is - insights from neuroscience and translating them into hands-on marketing principles.

#### üß† the triune brain 
Popular framework. See the human brain as three parts: 
- greedy animal decisions
- emotional pressures
- rational decision-making

Translate this into 
- new brain - thinks
- middle brain - feels 
- ==old brain== - decides (the oldest part of the brain)

#### üí° key insight: It is the old brain we need to convince. 

The old brain is highly selfish and seeks survival. That means: 
- ALL ABOUT ME - Avoid lang that doesn't side or care about the audience problems
- WHAT IS THE CONTRAST? Easily triggered with changes. That's why the tactic of before/after works well
- TANGIBLE - Doesn't want to think hard to spoon feed lang that is clear/resonating. 
- NOVELTY - Old brain is triggered by change so that means START/END must be meaningful. So Different Trumps Same
- Visual - Show don't tell speaks more 
- Emotion - Emotional stimuli gets the old brain easier

#### Takeaway üëç

Formula
**Selling probability**¬†= Pain x Claim x Gain x (Old Brain)
-  **#1 Address the pain** - Know how they speak (word choice), identify the symptoms, confirm the pain, agree on the problem
- **#2 Differentiate YOUR claim** - Make the contrast clear between you and them. Make your product unique and claim your specialty
- **#3 Show proof of claims (gains)** - customer testimonials (full name + photo or video), neutral expert opinions, third-party reviews, verified (scientific) studies

Delivery format: 
- Start with a grabber (unexpected but connects to your message) - *E.x. Cancer cures smoking - Cancer society - Don't use lang everyone uses
- Use large visuals
- Be laser-focused on the target customer‚Äôs benefits

#### üö´ Actions that hinder the decision-making process:

1. Focusing on yourself, your company, or your product, excluding your target and his or her needs.¬†**The old brain is selfish, remember?**
2. Not providing contrasting reasons that support your selling proposition.¬†**Contrast is important.**¬†
3. Being too conceptual and requiring thought.¬†**Your messages need to be simple, and tangible.**¬†
4. Communicating unnecessary content and not emphasizing selling points at the beginning and the end.¬†**Address the pain, and differentiate your claims.**¬†
5. Relying too heavily on words, both spoken and written.¬†**Use visuals.**¬†
6. Lacking emotion

### Cognitive Biases

See the [Cognitive Codex](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Cognitive_bias_codex_en.svg)

Anchoring - nearby data or the first data you see constrains your ability to evaluate more broadly can unveil a far better approach

Recency Bias - prefer fresh data over older data? not always better

False-Consensus Bias - you tend to think too much that other ppl think like you or are like you. same opinion/preferences

Curse of knowledge- you know so much that you can't think beyond what you know. You can't unknow things. Can't sit as someone who is new

Egocentric Bias - recalling past outcome better than what they likely were to self-build

Selective Perception - the way you frame things affects resposnes (leading questions). 
"Look at the terrible car" or "Would you want this juicy apple or dry potato"

Confirmation Bias- "test things that confirm their beliefs"

Congruence Bias-test theoories exclusively through direct testing instead of testing possible altv. hypothesis.  Instead try testing multiple different theories 

Clustering Illusion - mistakingly perceive small samples from random distributions to have significant "streaks" or "clusters"... you think you spotted a trend and base your optimization/hypotheses off that trend...but it really was just a small sample, not stat sig.

Based on [Dr. Cugelman's Interactive Behavior Change Model](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-39764-6_10). Key principles for shaping behavior are: 

- **Sources and identity**: We target our customers‚Äô self-identity and relationship with our brand to enhance how they identify with us and trust our company, products, and services.¬†¬†
  
- **Perceptions**: We aim to shape the sensory and processing systems of our audiences to influence what they notice and how they perceive our messages.¬†¬†
  
- **Classifications**: We design around how people conceptualize the world to boost the odds that they think about us in the way that is most beneficial.¬†¬†
  
- **Emotions & trust**: We target the emotions that motivate our audiences and ensure that there is nothing that could trigger distrust, which would stop them from acting.¬†¬†
  
- **Decision-making**: To aid decision-making, we‚Äôll employ several cognitive judgment strategies to boost the odds that our product is the ‚Äúrational‚Äù choice.¬†¬†
  
- **Action**: Most influence is about getting people to do things, and it‚Äôs here that we‚Äôll focus on how to get people acting and how to reinforce their behavior to keep it going.

### Source & Identity

- Forer Effect
- Endowment Effect (aka IKEA effect)
- Autonomy
- Belonging & Conformity 
- Mimicry
- Domestic bias
- Country of origin bias


==Forer Effect== - *we most easily identiy with vague, mostly positive, & general personality descriptions. E.x. Are you the kind of person that likes to share knowledge?*\

Tips: 
- Refer to rather vague and general personality traits (e.g. ‚ÄúAre you the kind of person that likes to share knowledge?‚Äù).
- They list mainly positive traits of your brand or products.
- Mention that your solution is perfect for ‚Äòthese kinds of people‚Äô (and test with having ‚Äòan authority‚Äô mentioning it about you).

==Endowment effect== - When we own goods, we value them higher than when we don‚Äôt. We expect more money when selling a product than what we‚Äôre willing to pay when buying. 

Tips: 
- Use trial periods, so your customers feel like they already own the product.
- Imply a ‚Äòreturn for free‚Äô policy (obligatory in a lot of countries).
- Among existing customers, experiment by asking whether or not they are willing to sell the product for the price they paid. This might make them realize how much they value your product.
- If it works, show your prospective customers how unwilling your existing customers are to sell.
- When a customer leaves you, try to make him realize the good things he‚Äôll lose that he ‚Äúowns‚Äù.
- Realize that prospects probably value their current choice more than they rationally should.
- Allow people to tailor your product. Not just to satisfy individual preferences, but also to invest cognitive effort and thereby liking (you might even allow your customers to create and design their own products).

==Autonomy== - *We prefer situations that we have control over*
We are happier and more motivated when we think we have choice and are doing it of our own accord

Tips: 
If you want users to repeatedly visit and act:

- Prevent mandatory fields and steps
- Introduce choices (even trivial ones work)
- Allow users to freely go backward and forward
- Be careful with external rewards and deadlines

==Belonging & Conformity== - *We prefer to behave in approval with our social groups*
We innately crave to belong to a group. Once we belong, we conform and internalize the group's values and norms. We conform to both implied and explicit behavior...and behave adversely to groups we don't want association. The company brand, product, and services are social objects that inherently form & play within social groups.  Does your prospect want to belong and conform to your group?

Tips; 
- Support the forming of groups, connections, and dialogues among your customers and prospects (be it on your own platforms or previously existing ones).
- Find and nourish the influencers within the more important social groups (e.g. on Facebook or niche platforms).
- Aggregate as much information about a specific customer or prospect and show that you‚Äôre approved of by his or her social peer group (from the device he uses to more advanced log-in or Facebook profiling data).
- Show your customer that members of his social peer group are buyers, users, and advocates (e.g. with ratings, reviews, or Facebook piles).

==Mimicry== - *when others mimic our behavior, we like them more. For example, when I mimic you smiling at me during a conversation, you‚Äôll like me more. We will also be more likely to bond together and our conversation will be much more fluent.

There are two paths via which mimicry can be used to persuade us. First, we mimic the consuming behavior of others (we eat more if we see others eating lots). Second, when our mannerisms are mimicked (such as smiling, shaking feet, fondling hair, etc.) we like the other more, making us more vulnerable to persuasion.

Mimic the behavior of your customer:

- Verbally mimic your customers‚Äô terminology and dialogue (social networking sites, reviews, feedback tools, etc. are great places to learn about your customer linguistics‚Ä¶).
- If your customer care center uses webcams, instruct them to mimic their customer‚Äôs behavior.

Make your customer mimic behavior:

- Use pictures showing actual consumers buying or consuming your product (not only on your site but also on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and other social media platforms).
- The same applies to videos: Post videos of actual people shopping for your product. Show who actually buys and/or uses your product (a Facebook pile is easy to implement).

==Domestic Country Bias== - *we prefer domestic products over imported ones.
Some products perform better when the local pop believes their domestic production is superior or has stronger positive resonance (e.g. nationalism)

Tips: 

When operating abroad:
- Don‚Äôt promote your domestic origin as a USP
- Try to sell your product through local domestic retailers
- On patriotic days, save your online marketing budgets for better times

When operating domestically:
- Subtly remind your customers of your shared domestic origins (also through using domestic icons, colors, ‚Ä¶)
- Use a local suffix instead of a .com .eu etc. one
- On patriotic days, boost your online marketing efforts and increase your ‚Äòdomesticity‚Äô.

==Country of Origin-effect== - *we prefer products from stereotypical countries*
We tend to stereotype products based on their country of origin. This effect is specific to a product category and particularly relevant for brands with a weak country of origin (e.g. countries that we stereotype as producing low-quality goods). Especially quality perception is vulnerable to the Country of Origin effect and the effect is higher when we‚Äôre a novice in the market. However, research also found that providing counter-evidence or making someone imagine a counter-stereotype experience, helps to mitigate negative country of origin perceptions.

First, analyze whether your country of origin is advantageous or disadvantageous.

When advantageous:
- Subtly remind your customers of your country of origin (e.g. by mentioning, using country-specific icons, colors, etc.)
- Co-brand with other countries stereotypes (icons, brands, products, etc.)

When disadvantageous:
- Try to sell your product through retailers that originate from a ‚Äòpositive country of origin‚Äô
- And either avoid or minimally mention your country of origin, or
- Activate counter-stereotypical associations. For example, by advertising product attributes that replace preconceived country notions, display counter-stereotyped ratings and reviews



### Perception 

- Top Left gets most views
  
- Left side gets more than right side
- Most ppl read in F-patterns 
  
- ==Perceptual incongruence== (this stands out, click!); But also disrupt the pattern 
	- Do something unexpected when someone enters your website (or other platform).
	- Within your own platforms, use incongruent colors, fonts, images, etc. for important content and interactions. 
	- Purposely advertise on thematically incongruent platforms.
	- Make the total look and feel of your ads incongruent with each advertising platform.
  
- Setting ==Visual Cue== helps (eye handholding)
	- Use a visual cue to emphasize your most important content/USP/CTA.
	- If you have multiple chunks of content, visual cues will help your customer consume these chunks in a logical, manageable order.
	- If you have more content than what‚Äôs visible (below the fold or on next pages), use cues to direct attention to it.
  
- ==Positional bias== (top of the page)
  
- Use power headlines, high quality images
  
==- Focusing effec==t - pay attention to 3 things, Max
	- Put the focus on only a few (a max of three) USP‚Äôs.
	- Emphasize your unique USP so intensely that your customers lose focus on less favorable aspects. Don‚Äôt just focus on your best aspects, but also on those that differ significantly from your competitors. 
	- Also, emphasize the huge change that happens the moment people buy your product or use your service.
  
==- Gaze cueing== - We are attracted to eyes and where they look!
	- When using faces on your website, direct their look towards the most important element(s) on your page.
	- Consistently place your important elements -like your CTA- on one side (the right side is optimal), and have faces on your site looking in that direction.
	- Place negative elements (i.e. prices) outside the perceived gaze direction.
  
- We are attracted to faces
  
- ==Attentional bias== - the more emotionally stimulated, the more we pay attention
	- If your brand or product is related in a positive way to intense emotion, promote this visually and contextually.
	- Display your USPs and CTA close to the most emotionally dominant parts of your page (e.g. an expressive image).
	- Place counter-persuasive elements (like ‚Äòterms & conditions or ‚Äòprivacy‚Äô) away from the emotionally dominant parts of your page.


### Classifications
How do people classify & make sense of the world. How to increase the odds people think about your brand, product, & offers positively

- ==Availability heuristic== - When I can imagine an event, I believe it happens more often. We judge probability based on how easy it is to envision/recall 
	- Use anecdotes (easy to recall).
	- Use examples that are frequently and/or recently covered in the media.
	- Use USPs and arguments that are vivid, unusual, and/or emotionally charged.

- ==Context-Dependent Memory== - I tend to forget things when I am out of context. I recall things more when in context. Entering a kitchen, I recall I needed to get a juicer. 
	- In general: Try to create a consistent context in your online presence across platforms and sites using the same contextual cues (from SEO, SEA, display, sites, to apps and social media, etc.).
	- When you want a visitor to remember you or your offer at some point, prime them with contextual cues that will be present in the situation where you want them to remember you.
	- When you have a recurring visitor, use cues from their previous visit to help them remember that visit.
  
- ==Cognitive Fluency== - we like things easy to remember and are familiar. I want to think less. Keep it simple, stupid. Hard to read, hard to buy. Previous positive experiences matter, so make that first UX memorable. Make things simple as possible
  
- ==Associative Priming== - I think of things that are in relation to other things more easily. Like a moon is associated with light and dark, wolf, sleep. Use strategic stimuli to pre-associate feelings (warm coffee = feels nice, hearth, positive mood)
	- Think about which subconscious emotions and conscious thoughts are involved in buying your product, and subtly prime these during your online dialogue.
	- For primers, use and test: emotions, matching and stereotyping content, colors, and images (but also the complete look and feel of your pages).
	- Also consider each desired sub-interaction, and micro-prime these in the step(s) above.
	- Be cautious of obvious priming, which can cause a so-called ‚Äòreverse-priming‚Äô reaction.
	- Thoroughly scan your online dialogue for negative primes (e.g. minuses, crosses, asterisks, or colors and images that mismatch the desired prime).
  
- ==Front loading== - Start with the "So What". Don't bury or lead up to the point. It takes too much memory space. Conclusion first, everything else second! Apply this to:
	- Page title-level (web/mobile) and subject line-level (e-mail).
	- Introduction-level: put your most important content in the upper-left corner of your ‚Äòentry-page‚Äô or e-mail.
	- Page-level: in your title and introductory paragraph.
	- Paragraph-level: in the first sentence.
	- Sentence level: in the first words of the sentence.

- ==Cognitive Dissonance== - we don't the natural state when our beliefs and behavior are at odds. More easily we change our beliefs than our behavior (more frictional/effort). E.x. when the fox couldn't get the grape, he said it wasn't good to get the grape anyways since it isn't ripe as it hadn't fallen. Setup your customers to internalize their dissonance of belief re: your solution and their behavior. Why their belief of your value increases as they become hooked
	- Play hard to get. 
	- Be expensive.
	- Be hard to get rid of.
	- Don‚Äôt offer (large) incentives when asking your customers for a favor (such as ratings and reviews).
	- Even test providing incentives for not buying your product (e.g. in your checkout page).

- ==Ambiguity Aversion== - we don't like things that are uncertain as we think the party that knows the odds is deceiving us. We like things that have more certainty (take bets on more "sure" things)
	- Be specific in your offer and communication style (instead of offering vague information).
	- Be specific about what happens when people click on a call to action.
	- Provide ‚Äòfeed-forward‚Äô information (‚Äòwhat‚Äôs next is‚Ä¶‚Äô).
	- Use fixed discounts instead of a chance to win.
	- Try to find the ambiguities in your competitor‚Äôs offer and emphasize your certainty there.
	- Guarantee your offer (money back, no cure = no pay).
	- Within your portfolio, make your cash cow the ‚Äòmost certain offer‚Äô.
	- Finally: In places that need improvement, experiment with small doses of uncertainty.

- ==Choice-supportive bias== - I chose this and so I recall more positive aspects of the choice than negative. Our memory protects our ego
	- Test by asking your users why they visit your website or use your app.
	- Ask them why they bought and use your product.
	- Show previously visited pages and bought items!


### Emotion & Trust

[[Wheel of Persuasion]]


People buy in relation to their emotions. Trust in of itself won't motivate action but distrust will kill action. 


==Mood heuristic== - presented with the same facts, our mood (positive or negative) makes us more or less likely to take risk
	- Test inducing a tiny bit of sadness or melancholy if you want users to make a conservative choice (like renewing a subscription).
	- Make sure that when you induce a negative mood, you clearly provide the comforting and reassuring aspects of your offer.

==Self-efficacy & autonomy== - we are more likely to take action when we think we are capable based on our innate talent or seeing others like us. Also when we believe we have "control" and not forced externally, we feel less stress/uncertainty. 
	- Provide instant feedback on correct behavior (i.e. green check marks appear when fields are filled in correctly).
	- Visualize the simplicity of procedures (a progress indicator with three ‚Äì five clear steps, an easy-looking infographic, etc).
	- Show existing customers who have previously bought items or taken action.
	- Use ‚Äòhow-to‚Äô pages (and possibly videos) where you show your visitor how easy it is to act.
	- Use social proof (i.e. 12,452 others bought a product with us today).
	- Prevent mandatory fields and steps
	- Introduce choices (even trivial ones work)
	- Allow users to freely go backward and forward
	- Be careful with external rewards and deadlines

==Peak-End Rule== - how much we remember something is the ending & peak climax of the event. The example is a patient that had really sharp pain at the beginning and peak of surgery even if the duration was shorter than another patient that had pain for a longer duration..the first person remembers it a lot more saliently
	Bring your ‚Äòenlightening moments‚Äò from your sales dialogue together in one happy climax.
	If possible, make sure that this positive peak is at the end of your sales dialogue.
	Next, map out all service dialogues, micro-conversions, and other ‚Äòexit points‚Äô.
	Create small positive peaks there, too.
	Use enticing extras, such as the good old ‚Äòunexpected gift on your thank-you pages!‚Äô, or specific extras such as unlocking badges or access to exclusive content, games, or apps.

==Commitment bias / endowment effect== - we value things more when we own it and put time into it. the ikea effect
	Allow people to tailor your product (not just to satisfy individual preferences but also to invest effort, thereby liking your product more).
	You might even allow your customers to create and design their own products.
	In your sales dialogue, don‚Äôt just focus on usability (decreasing effort) but play with the opposite as well (‚Äúplay hard to get‚Äù) to find the optimal mixture of effort that maximizes liking while ensuring that your customers find the digital sales dialogue simple enough.

==Emphasis Framing== - The meaning of a message matters based on how it is framed. Ex. A car can be framed in terms of its cost effective, environmental impact, or speed. The framing matters based on the audience
- What can you find out about the meaningful frames that your customer uses in your type of business and the values associated with them (i.e. Google searches, subjects read, poll answers)?
- Are his frames to your advantage (or don‚Äôt you know his frames)? Then emphasize the frame consistent aspects of your solution (i.e. in the name of your product/solution, description, comparison, images, and colors used)
- Are they disadvantageous? Then try you the customer to shift his frame by first emphasizing information that doesn‚Äôt fit the frame your customer uses, trying to switch to a better frame.

### Decision-making
- It is their decision, emotionally 
- Limit the options
- Make the contrast focused, and criteria linked that favors your positioning
- Make rewards/incentives obtainable or in the near-term
- Steer against status quo by invoking the cost of not switching or making the new path less of a resistance
- Manipulate the base rate with definitions that work for you 
- Leverage equivalence framing to focus the right value prop & features to the audience (35% fat vs. 65% fat free)

#### üì£ Takeaway
Create a vision for prospects in a way that it is their decision to participate. People will decide what they want to. 

üö´ Do not tell them what to do, how to think, what is best. Nudge them to self-discover what feels right/best and present your case using: 
- simple, relevant, familiar language 
- clear contrast
- tangible demos

Their ultimate decision is rooted in self-interest that is emotional "I want this, I need this". 

Give more than one option but not more than 3...max 5 but that is really dependent on the customer and domain. Generally too much will kill decisioning
