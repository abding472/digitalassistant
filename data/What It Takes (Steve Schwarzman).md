### Remove Obstacles

We are made, not born. To tackle big challenges, I need to be forged: 
- ==Have great mentors==
- ==Take a vision on big things. Develop a viewpoint and back-solve==
- ==Tolerate a lot of pain from failure as cost of ambition== 
- ==Simplify complex issues into 2-3 core issues that shape outcome
- ==Listen to find common ground==
- ==Assemble a great team who can help you answer things you can't solve==
- ==Pick adventures that challenge you, compel you to learn new things

> *Failure is worse than you can imagine. But your ability to meet that challenge is beyond what any imagination you have.*
> 
> *I had incredible teachers. My parents taught me the values of honesty, common decency, and achievement, and the importance of generosity toward others. My high school track coach, Jack Armstrong, helped me develop a high tolerance for pain and understand to understand the power of preparation, essential lessons for any entrepreneur. Running track...I learned about loyalty and what it means to be part of a team.* 
> 
> *I learned to listen to people, pay attention to what they want and need even when they don't say it, and be fearless when it comes to tackling difficult problems.*
> 
> *What I lacked...I made up for with my abiklity to see patterns and develop new solutions and paradigms, and with the sheer will to turn my ideas into reality....Finance allowed me to refine my ability to simplify complex problems by focusing on only the two or three issues that will determine the outcome.* 
> 
> *If you want something badly enough, you can find a way. You can create it out of nothing. But wanting something isn't enough. If you're going to pursue difficult goals, you're inevitably going to fall short sometimes. It's one of the costs of ambition*. *Calling Harvard dean and failing, I practically collapsed. I had overestimated my ability to sell myself*
> 
> *I figured the best I could do was win an Ivy League sprint title. To do that, though, I'd have to train for a lackluster coach and a team that didn't seem to care about me. So, uncharacteristically, I quit. I wasn't sure what I wanted yet, but track, which had been such a formative part of my life, no longer seemed the way to get there*
> 
> *If you're going to commit yourself to something, it's as easy to do something big as it is to do something small. Both will consume your time and energy, so make sure your fantasy is worthy of your pursuit, with rewards commensurate to your efforts.*

### Everything is Interconnected

Be an effective synthesizer. 
- ==Look for the problems
- ==Identify patterns
- ==Be with the best. Create connections & improve them
- ==Don't be overwhelmed or get lost
- ==Discourse respectfully.==
- ==Know who I am, what I excel & weak at in creating value

> *I want to be a telephone switchboard, taking in information from countless feeds, sorting it, and sending it back out into the world
> 
> *Everything in business relates to everything else. For a business to succeed, each part has to work on its own and with all the other parts. It's a closed, integrated system, organized by managers. If you are making cars, you have to have good research so you'll know what people want to buy; good design, engineering, and manufacturing so you can produce a good product; effective programs to recruit and train your llabor force; good marketing so you can create desire for what you are making; and good salespeople who know how to close deals. If any parts in the system break and you can't fix them quickly, you risk losing money and going out of business...I learned to spot patterns, sense the problems, and suggest potential solutions without getting lost in the numbers.*
> 
> Frankly I don't know much about DLJ, but it seems you've got all these amazing young people working here. So I want to do whatever they are doing. I need $10,500. It's not a big deal to you, but it's a really big deal to me. 
> 
> Even today, say the word Genesco, and I can feel moisture trickle down my back, the fear that at any point someone will walk in, ask me a question, and expose me as a fraud.*

### Interviewing + Hiring

Be an effective talent hunter & communicator. 
- ==Know what strengths looking for 
- ==Can they handle uncertainty & find common ground to build on
- ==Can they sit in the interviewer's shoes?
- ==Prepared with familiar topics

>*Before you hire , you need to define who you are and what your values are. Those values guide how you decide to hire and how you predict their behavior*
> 
> *I don't have a formula, but my goal is to get into their heads: 1) who they are, 2) how they think, and 3) whether they are right for the culture 
> 
> I make note of consistency in narratives and special notes of anomalies or stand out pieces of information
> 
> Do they withdraw or find a way to actively participate. Does the unexpected situation make them nervous or uncomfortable...even if they know nothing, can they find common ground and enjoy the conversation. 
> 
> If they are familiar with the topic, how do they approach discussion. Do they have a point of view? Is their assessment logical & analytical? 
> 
> Ultimately how do they deal with uncertainty. Can they demonstrate ability to connect, engage, pivot, and change within conversation?
> 
> Managing people is not managing a deal. You can be impatient to do the deal but you can’t with the team. Even if something takes 10min, you’d break a lot of glass like the trust people have in themselves and in you. You need to be a lot more strategic.
> 
> As a leader, You have to be the one who clearly articulates the value system repeatedly. As a leader, people pay far more attention to your words than you realize. So it means choosing what you say and what you do and how often you do it, matters.

### The Best Way to Learn is By Doing, All Deals are Crises, Money is Poor Cure for Bad Situation

Know the success drivers
- ==Make it simple. Get to what the other needs
- ==Avoid the killer mistakes 
- ==Be with the best
- ==Breathe slowly, think clearly. Control temper
- ==Don't worry about haters.

> *Investors are always looking for great investments. The easier you make it for them, the better for everyone
> 
> Change is hostile to people. You as the initiator need to go out of your way to make it easy for them. Understand your motives so they are willing to subscribe
> 
> I had been freaked out by my mistake that instead of tearing out the bad pages, I torn out the good ones. I could have melted under the table...right before they called the airplane, Eric turned to me :"If you ever do that to me again, I'm firing you on the spot"
> 
> He never stopped asking questions-torrential, relentless questions--and he instantly grasped the links between one idea and another even if they were entirely new to him. He was like Tarzan swinging through knowledge trees at blistering speed, never missing a vine, learning more quickly than I could teach
> 
> If you...cross paths with the best people of your generation, you'll keep running into them.
> 
> Every point in every negotiation was a fight, with a winner and a loser. People in this business weren't interested in carving up the pie so everyone got a slice....I observed that when I was the one making the decisions and the voices rose and tempers flared, my heart would beat faster and my breathing would become more shallow. I became less effective, less in control of my own cognitive responses. The fix, I found was to focus on my breathing, slow it down and relax my shoulders, until my breaths were long and deep. The effect was astonishing. My thoughts became clearer. I became more objective and rational about the situation at hand, about what I needed to do to win. 
> 
> I learned that deals ultimately come down to a few key points that matter most to each side. If you can clear everything else away and focus on these points, you will be an effective negotiator. You cannot let all the voices, paperwork, and deadlines overwhelm you. 
> 
> I didn't just try selling whatever it was I had to sell. I listened. I waited to hear what people wanted, what was on their mind, then set about making it happen. In meetings I pay very close attention to what the other person is saying and the way he or she is saying it. I try to find some point of connection, an area of common ground, a shared interest or experience that turns a professional encounter into a more personal one. A lot of people fail because they start from a position of self interest. What's in this for me. They never go to do the most interesting and rewarding work. Listening closely and watching the way people talks puts me much closer to answering the question I'm always asking myself, which is: How can I help? If I can help someone and become a friend to their situation, everything follows. There is nothing more interesting to people than their own problems. If you can find out what they are and come up with solutions, they will want to talk to you no matter rank or status. The harder the problem and scarcer the solution, the more valuable your advice is. It's in those situations, where everyone is walking away with averted eyes, that the field clears and the greatest opportunity awaits.
