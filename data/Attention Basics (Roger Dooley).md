#### Oxytocin & First Impressions

Hugs create oxytocin. Oxytocin is the chemical underlying trust. 
We form impressions in 30-50 ms. This is before we read headlines. Instantaneous first impression. First impressions are difficult to change. Even when we prevent counter evidence, it doesn't change immediately
Do I trust the site? Are they good?

What drives first impressions?

==Visual Design== - look & feel. Websites with low visual complexity & high prototypicality (how representative a design looks for a certain category of websites) were perceived as highly appealing. Be mindful when you try to go off the beaten path, it will take time for people to understand and follow

==Value Proposition ==- Who are you, What do you deliver, and why are you better? Typical structure: 
- **Headline:** State the end-benefit of your offering in 1 short sentence. You can mention the product and/or the customer. Make it an attention grabber.
- **Sub-headline or a 2-3 sentence paragraph:** A specific explanation of what you do/offer, for whom, and why is it useful.
- **3 bullet points:** List the key benefits or features.
- **Visual:** Images communicate much faster than words. Show the product, the hero shot or an image reinforcing your main message.

Guidelines
- Clarity. The message could not possibly be misinterpreted.
- It communicates the concrete results a customer will get from purchasing and using your products and/or services.
- It says how it’s different or better than the competitor’s offer.
- It avoids hype (like ‘never seen before amazing miracle product’), superlatives (‘best’) and business jargon (‘value-added interactions’).
- It can be read and understood in about 5 seconds.

==Compelling Imagery & Graphics==
- photo relevant to target audience
- gaze cueing to copy
- Avoid too much imagery

#### Attention factors (internal vs. external)

External (Objective)
- sense intensity (sound, smell, sight colors)
- changes in stimulus (sudden loud noise, state change)
- movement (animation)
- size & color contrast 
- novelty
- repetition (logo, copy, image)

Internal (Subjective)
- Interests 
- Habits/Attitudes 
- Motives & Psych states
- Emotions
- Past experiences

#### Cognitive Load

Mental energy to process a thought or experience. Minimizing load helps increase attention span

Types of cognitive load: 

- Intrinsic cognitive load - information complexity. the load depends on how complex the task or concept that is presented and the learner's ability to absorb
	- Chunk it down: You can chunk it down and separate it into layers for the learning to be easier. Reduce how overwhelming the task is at hand

- Extraneous Cognitive load - how difficult is the teacher or the tool or instructions on the student. Bad teaching methods make learning more difficult and increase load
	- Effective presentation methods reduce cognitive load, allowing the learner to stay focused on their mission, whether that be learning anatomy or deciding which pricing plan to go with.

- Germane Cognitive Load - leveraging schemas which are frameworks for how to understand the ideas and objects we encounter. Schemas allow us to identify and differentiate between elements we encounter in the world

#### Advertisement as clutter? 

Directionally, yes. Adding ads to a page does introduce clutter and reduce the session user's understanding of the page - especially if they are first time visit. Both the type of ad (the brand being marketing), how it is presented (size, color, photo), and the webpage is own content juxtaposition matters. 

#### Eye Gazing

More simple websites allow users to perform tasks more readily. Go through a design prototype and prioritize what you want the user to focus on to complete their task. Play with the image and positioning\

People scan pages differently when they are searching vs. they are in discovery 

Layer Cake Pattern - they explore horizontal sections quickly to see if the section is relevant
Spotted Pattern - If the section is relevant, then they dot around to get key content
