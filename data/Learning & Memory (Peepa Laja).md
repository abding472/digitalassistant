### Psychology of Learning 

- Classic Conditioning 
- Operant Conditioning
- Observational Learning

Classic conditioning - form an association between a neutral stimulus and evoking stimulus (unconditioned stimulus). Ex. Pavlov experiment (bell, food). The unconditioned stimulus (food) caused an unconditioned response (salivating)

Operant conditioning - learning through positive & negative reinforcement. X Behavior Y Reward or Punishment

Observational - learning through observing and imitating. Key process steps: 
- Attention – the degree to which the observer notices the imitated behavior.
- Retention – the ability for of the imitator to form a memory of the imitated behavior.
- Reproduction – the observer must have the motor skills and physical ability required to imitate the behavior.
- Motivation – for the observer, perceived rewards must outweigh perceived costs.

### Psychology of Memory

Memory has three key process steps: 
- Encoding - turning the information from the experience into a usable state
- Storage - after encoding store in memory for later retrieval. 
- Retrieval - bring stored memories into conscious 

It’s helpful to set goals before you test, so you have a clear idea of what answers you’d like to hear from your users. 

Fuzzy recall - For instance, if your users recognize an aspect of your product, but can’t retrieve the specific memory, then your marketing wasn’t fully effective.  

Strong recall - If they can recall specific product details, then you know that you were able to reach out to them and help them understand and acquire that information quickly.
