### What are the 4 key mental processes that shape decisioning?

1. Cognitive Bias
2. Memories
3. Reason
4. Emotions

### The two system brain

Think of the brain as a dual processing machine: 
System 1 - subconcious, emotional processes
System 2 - conscious, rational processes

Think of a person as two users. You're task is figure out which system is driving the decisions & behavior

These two systems help each others and co-dependent. 

System2 really needs focus to process. Prefers to be absent, minimize energy exerted

System1 fully automated response. we can't help it. It is fully associative, when one concept is activated - other concepts also get activated. It is a neural network. Spelling out things in a simple way with clear contrast makes it easy to absorb (80 cents cost per month for a mattress!)

We think system2 is in control when in reality a lot of our driver is from system1

We come up with ratios (post decision rationalize). Trying to comfort ourselves that we are rational beings. We self-justify our behavior after our system1 has already decided

### Master moment of decisioning

Decision = Determined view after consideration. 
We tend to after rationalize and explain. In the moment of making decision, it isn't as rational as we think it is. Evolution shaped our brain for optimal decisioning. Our brain isn't perfect but efficient at decisoning. Brain has 100B neurons. Each neuron has 10K connections. We have more connections in our brain than there are atoms in universe. This is important bc brain is the source of our decisions. 

### Attention | Emotion | Memory
We need to focus, have emotional response, and loaded into our memory

Attention-apply mind to something. The way eye works is we don't see everything, around it is blurry. We see color around the room is that for 50ms the eyes start and moves around the room for each point of the room. That data is stored & brain remembers and gives full color vision. 

#### ðŸ“£ We miss loads of info based on our attention. 
When the brain focuses on something, it allocates resources to our attention & ignore the rest. Things get blurry around the fringes as the brain focuses and optimizes memory on our attention

Important: understand that when we apply attention, the brain filters out other things

#### ðŸ“£ Emotions are unconscious whereas feelings are conscious
Emotions are low level responses to positive or negative stimuli. When the response grows large enough that is no longer subconscious but conscious, then it becomes feelings. That's why the emotional impact matters because it shapes our motivation to take action 

#### ðŸ“£ Memory shapes experience. Stronger reactions will lead to stronger activation & control experience
Branding works well when it creates strong memory resonance. How does it tie to the product
